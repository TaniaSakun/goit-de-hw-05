The repository for the 5th GoItNeo Data Engineering homework

# Task Description:

1. Creating Topics in Kafka:

Create three topics in Kafka:

_building_sensors_ â€” to store data from all sensors.
_temperature_alerts_ â€” to store notifications about exceeding the allowable temperature threshold.
_humidity_alerts_ â€” to store notifications about exceeding or falling below the allowable humidity range.

2. Sending Data to Topics:

Write a Python script that simulates a sensor and periodically sends randomly generated data (temperature and humidity) to the building_sensors topic.

The data should include the sensor ID, timestamp, and corresponding readings.
One run of the script should correspond to a single sensor. In order to simulate multiple sensors, the script needs to be executed multiple times.
The sensor ID can be a random number but should remain constant for each script run. When the script is run again, the sensor ID can change.

Temperature should be a random value between 25 and 45.
Humidity should be a random value between 15 and 85.

3. Data Processing:

Write a Python script that subscribes to the building_sensors topic, reads messages, and checks the received data:

If the temperature exceeds 40Â°C, generate a notification and send it to the temperature_alerts topic.
If the humidity exceeds 80% or falls below 20%, generate a notification and send it to the humidity_alerts topic.
The notifications should contain the sensor ID, the readings, timestamp, and a message about exceeding the threshold.

4. Final Data:

Write a Python script that subscribes to the temperature_alerts and humidity_alerts topics, reads the notifications, and displays the messages on the screen.
